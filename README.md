# KindKart
KindKart aims to bridge the gap between surplus food donors (restaurants, events, hostels, households, etc.) and people in need by creating a real-time, user-friendly platform for food redistribution. Inspired by food delivery apps like Swiggy and Zomato, KindKart ensures fast, transparent, and efficient delivery of excess food to the hungry.
